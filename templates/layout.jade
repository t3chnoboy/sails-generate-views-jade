      Stylesheets and Preprocessors
      ==============================

      You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
      using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
      of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, stylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
      here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
      are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
      a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Change the order of your CSS files
        + Import stylesheets from other directories
        + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

    block styles

    // STYLES
    // STYLES END

  body
    block body

    //
      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
      take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
      automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
      CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
      and concatenated into a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript


    // SCRIPTS
    // SCRIPTS END
